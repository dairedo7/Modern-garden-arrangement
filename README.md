# Modern-garden-arrangement
The project was made as a part of test assignment for adRespect.

This project showcases a web page where the seller offers a variety of modern garden arrangement services. The purpose of this website is to provide users with an engaging and informative platform to explore different garden arrangement options and to connect with the seller for their garden transformation needs.

**Features and Functionalities**
Intersection Observer Web API
I have utilized the Intersection Observer Web API to implement dynamic loading of content as the user scrolls down the page. This ensures a smooth and efficient browsing experience by loading content only when it's visible in the user's viewport.

**Masonry Gallery Layout**
The gallery section of the website features a visually appealing masonry layout. This layout allows images to fit together like a puzzle, creating an organized and aesthetically pleasing presentation of garden arrangement examples.
Motion animations have been added throughout the website using the Intersection Observer API.

**Image Modal Windows**
When users click on the preview images in the gallery, they can view the full-resolution versions in modal windows. This interactive feature enables users to closely examine the details of each garden arrangement.

**Slider for Offers**
The slider showcases different garden arrangement offers in a visually engaging manner. Users can navigate through the slider to explore various options and learn more about each offer.
